/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does. 
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitDefinition = "A software to save and keep record of coding projects";

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitHubDefinition =" a website that uses git to save, record, and manipulate projects."


//////////////////PROBLEMS 3 - 8////////////////////
/*
    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'init' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the init command.
*/

//CODE HERE
const init = {description: "creates an empty Git repository.", code: "git init"};

//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'clone' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the clone command.
*/

//CODE HERE
const clone = {description: "clones a repository into a newly created directory", code: "git clone <URL>"};

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////

*/

//CODE HERE
const status = {description: "Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working tree and the index file, and paths in the working tree that are not tracked by Git", code: "git status"};

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'add' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the add command.
*/

//CODE HERE
const add = {description: "This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.", code: "git add <file here>"};

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'commit' with 'description' and 'code' properties
    following the guidelines above to describe the commit command.
*/

//CODE HERE
const commit = {description: "Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes.", code: "git commit -m <message here>"};


//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
